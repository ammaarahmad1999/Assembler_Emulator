#**Assembler and Emulator**

There are 3 subdirectories 
1. Assembler - Contains all cpp codes for Assembler
2. Emulator - Contain emu.c file for Emulator
3. Assembly_Codes - Contains asm test files

Along with these, it contain 2 txt files 
1. instructions.txt - Assembly Language Mnemonic, Opcode and OperandType 
2. opcode.txt - Assembly Language Mnemonic and Opcode

##**Running an Assembler (2 Step process)**

**cd Assembler** \
**g++ asm.cpp -o asm** \
**./asm filename.asm** \

Here filename.asm denotes a assembly code to be assembled. \
Default directory for filename is **"../Assembly_Codes/"** 

It is a two pass assembler. It reports **errors** and **warnings** in **filename.log** file

If their are no errors while assembling it generates 2 files \
**filename.l** - Listing the memory location and opcode generated  for each line of assembly code \
**filename.o** - Object file to be executed by emulator

Note - All files generated are in present in subdirectory **Assembly_Codes** 

##**Running an emulator**

**cd Emulator** \
**gcc emu.c -o emu** \
**./emu -[operation] [filename.o]**

**operation** denotes operation to be performed. It supports four operations 
1. trace - It shows memory and register information after executing each line 
2. before - It shows memory dump before execution of object file 
3. after - It shows memory dump after execution of object file 
4. isa - It prints the instructions set in terminal - Same as instructions.txt

**filename.o** \
Object file to be executed - Execution terminates when HALT is encountered or
number of lines executed equals instructions read from object file.
